## Build Environment Setup

### Requirements
To build a custom ROM, youâ€™ll need the following tools and software:

- **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Recommended)**
  - Custom ROMs are best built on Linux, with Ubuntu being the most recommended distribution.
  - Ensure you have at least **16GB of RAM** and **100GB of free disk space** for building the ROM.

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
  - Install JDK 8 (preferred version) or newer. You can install it via:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
    ```

- **Repo Tool**
  - The `repo` tool is used to manage multiple Git repositories. Install it via:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install repo
    ```

- **Android SDK & NDK**
  - You'll need Android SDK and NDK for building AOSP or custom ROMs. You can download them from the [Android developer website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

- **Build Dependencies**
  - Install the required build dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install bc bison build-essential ccache clang curl flex g++-multilib git lib64stdc++6 libncurses5-dev libsdl1.2-dev libssl-dev libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev lzop pngcrush rsync schedtool squashfs-tools xsltproc zip zlib1g-dev
    ```

### Setting Up the Build Environment

1. **Set Up Your Directory**
   Create a directory where you will store all ROM source files:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/android/roms
   cd ~/android/roms

**Install dependencies**
``
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk git bc bison build-essential
``
**Sync the source code**
``
repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest
repo sync -j4
``
**Set up the build environment**

source build/envsetup.sh
lunch aosp_device-userdebug

**Build the ROM**
``
make -j4
``
Troubleshooting
"Device not found" error: Ensure device trees are properly configured.

"Dependency errors": Install all necessary dependencies.

"Out of memory": Increase swap file size or use more RAM.

- **Images**: I've used placeholder images for steps like cloning the repository, installing dependencies, syncing the source, setting up the environment, and building the ROM. You can replace these with real screenshots or images that illustrate each step of the process. If you want, I can generate or edit images based on your actual content.
